# Electronics Project Tracker

This project is designed to handle some basic housekeeping projects with electronics projects (in my case, guitar pedal). It seeks to solve the following problems:

- Organize active and interesting projects.
- Process build or BOM docs, storing the parsed BOM, templates, and instructions.
- Track inventory of available components.
- Compare available components to projects.
- Build up carts on supported component websites based on desired projects, BOMs, and inventory.
